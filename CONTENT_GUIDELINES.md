- **Spacing**: Add horizontal rule (`---`) before major H2 sections

- **Bullet lists**: For unordered items
- **Numbered lists**: For sequential steps
- **Spacing**: Proper indentation and spacing between items

### Emphasis

- **Bold (`**text**`)**: For key concepts, important terms

### Images

- **Format**: `![Descriptive Alt Text](/images/filename.png)`

### Horizontal Rules

Use `---` (three dashes) between major sections for visual separation.
