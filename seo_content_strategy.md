# SEO & Content Strategy for TaskFlow

## Target Audience Keywords
*   **Primary:** "task management for solopreneurs", "student planner app", "consultant project tracking", "productivity system for freelancers"
*   **Secondary:** "deep work tools", "focus mode app", "goal tracking software", "personal analytics dashboard"
*   **Long-tail:** "how to organize consulting projects", "best study planner for university students", "manage multiple side hustles app"

## Content Expansion Strategy
1.  **Problem-Agitation-Solution (PAS) Framework:**
    *   *Problem:* Overwhelmed by scattered tools (Notion for notes, Trello for tasks, Excel for goals).
    *   *Agitation:* Losing track of billable hours, missing assignment deadlines, feeling "busy but not productive."
    *   *Solution:* TaskFlow's unified "Cyber-Zen" system.

2.  **New Sections to Add:**
    *   **"How It Works" Step-by-Step:** Visual guide (Capture -> Organize -> Focus -> Analyze).
    *   **Use Case Deep Dives:** Specific tabs/sections for "For Students" (GPA tracking, assignment reminders) vs "For Consultants" (Client portals, billable hours).
    *   **Comparison Table:** "TaskFlow vs. The Rest" (highlighting offline-first, speed, and focus features).
    *   **FAQ Section:** Addressing common objections (data privacy, learning curve, pricing).

## SEO Optimization Checklist
*   **Meta Tags:** Title tags < 60 chars, descriptions < 160 chars with keywords.
*   **Heading Structure:** H1 (Main Keyword) -> H2 (Secondary Keywords) -> H3 (Long-tail).
*   **Semantic HTML:** Use `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>` for better crawling.
*   **Alt Text:** Descriptive alt text for all new 3D assets including keywords.
*   **Performance:** Ensure high Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS) despite rich visuals.

## Color Theme Update
*   **New Palette:** "Deep Space Violet"
    *   Background: Deep Obsidian/Indigo (`#0B0B15`)
    *   Primary Accent: Electric Violet/Purple (`#8B5CF6`)
    *   Secondary Accent: Cyan/Blue (`#06B6D4`) - *Replacing Green*
    *   Text: White/Grey (`#F3F4F6`)
