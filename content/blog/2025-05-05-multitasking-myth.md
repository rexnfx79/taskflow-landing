### Introduction
Picture this: You are on a Zoom call with a client. While they are talking, you are secretly checking your email in another window. A Slack notification pops up—a question from a colleague—and you quickly type a reply. You feel like a productivity ninja, juggling multiple balls with ease. You are getting so much done!

Except, you aren't. You are likely doing a terrible job at all three things. You missed a nuance in the client's request. Your email reply was curt and contained a typo. Your Slack answer was half-baked.

This is the myth of multitasking. We wear it as a badge of honor, a requirement for modern life. Job descriptions even ask for "excellent multitasking skills." But neuroscience is clear: the human brain cannot multitask. It can only **task-switch**. And the cost of that switching is devastating to your productivity and your IQ.

### The Neuroscience of Task-Switching
When you think you are doing two things at once, your brain is actually rapidly toggling between them. It's like a light switch flicking on and off a hundred times a minute.
*   **The Switch Cost:** Every time you switch, there is a metabolic cost. Your brain has to "unload" the context of Task A and "load" the context of Task B. This takes time—fractions of a second, but they add up.
*   **The Error Rate:** Studies show that when you switch tasks, your error rate goes up by 50%.
*   **The IQ Drop:** A study at the University of London found that subjects who multitasked during cognitive tasks experienced an IQ score decline similar to individuals who had stayed up all night or smoked marijuana.

### Continuous Partial Attention
Linda Stone, a former executive at Apple and Microsoft, coined the term "Continuous Partial Attention." It describes a state where we are constantly scanning the horizon for the next incoming stimulus. We are never fully present. We are always "on," but never fully engaged.

This state keeps our bodies in a constant "fight or flight" mode, flooding our system with cortisol and adrenaline. It leads to stress, anxiety, and a feeling of being constantly overwhelmed. It destroys our ability to experience "flow," that blissful state of deep absorption where true mastery happens.

### The Antidote: Single-Tasking
The solution is simple, but hard: Single-Tasking. Doing one thing at a time, with your full attention, until a stopping point is reached.

#### Strategies for Single-Tasking
1.  **The Tab Purge:** If you have 50 browser tabs open, you are inviting distraction. Close them. Keep only the tabs relevant to the current task open.
2.  **Notification Zero:** Turn off all non-human notifications. You do not need to know instantly that a stranger liked your tweet. Batch check your emails and messages at set times.
3.  **Time Blocking:** Dedicate specific blocks of time to specific tasks. "From 9 to 10, I write the report. I do nothing else."
4.  **The Parking Lot:** When a random thought pops into your head ("I need to buy milk," "I should email Bob"), don't do it. Write it down in a "Parking Lot" list and get back to work. Process the list later.

### TaskFlow: A Tool for Monotasking
TaskFlow is opinionated software. We believe in single-tasking.
*   **Focus Mode:** As mentioned in our Deep Work article, our Focus Mode physically hides other tasks. You cannot see the rest of your to-do list. You can only see the one thing you promised to do right now.
*   **Quick Capture:** Our global shortcut allows you to capture those "Parking Lot" items instantly without leaving your current context. You dump the thought and return to flow in seconds.
*   **Sequential Projects:** You can set up projects so that Task B only becomes visible after Task A is completed. This forces a linear workflow and prevents you from jumping ahead.

### Conclusion
Multitasking is a thief. It steals your time, your intelligence, and your peace of mind. By embracing single-tasking, you reclaim your cognitive power. You will find that you not only get more done, but the quality of your work improves, and you end the day feeling satisfied rather than drained.
